Le Carton
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maximx1/lecarton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maximx1/lecarton)

### Description
This is another pastebin clone that I wish to make with added functionality like:

* Timed delete
* Profiles
* Social constructs - commenting, following, and markdown
* Plugin support
* rss feeds

This amounts to a standalone gist.

### Deploy
Just run ``activator dist``

### To run
You can run with ``./activator run`` or just run the ``./jecommande run 8088``

### Data location
Default data location for running with jecommand is in the root of the project .data/
